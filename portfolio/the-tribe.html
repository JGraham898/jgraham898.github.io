                    <p>
                        THE TRIBE is a brand new platform designed to help
                        founders, program organisors, investors and mentors
                        involved in start-up accelerator programs.
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. The Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        The goal is to offer a founder-first approach, which
                        necessitates excellent user experience. However, as the
                        website was set up without any initial UX research,
                        there are some areas of confusion which need to be
                        addressed.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. The Solution</h3>

                    <p>
                        We set out to redesign some of the community
                        functionality features of the website and app to ensure
                        that users can network, upload information and find the
                        info they are looking for in a seamless, intuitive way
                        that is also aesthetically pleasing.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. My Role</h3>
                    <p>
                        I led the entire project and worked on user interviews,
                        testing and creating wireframes. I worked closely with
                        Maxx, the founder of TRIBE.

                <div class="portfolio-section-text">
                    <p>
                        My process for this project was based on the Design
                        thinking process: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype
                        and Test

                    <p>
                        The Tribe initally had an MVP release that had been
                        implemented by the engineers without any UX design
                        input. My first step was to conduct usability
                        testing/research interviews with 5 primary users
                        (startup founders) to identify any pain points they were
                        experiencing with the MVP release.
                    </p>
                    <p>My research involved:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Empathising with user needs and goals</li>
                        <li>
                            Discovering pain points in current user journeys
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Determining user satisfaction with their experience
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        During the interviews, I observed them interacting with
                        the app/website and narrating their thoughts as they
                        went through different user journeys:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Editing their personal profile</li>
                        <li>Editing their venture page and pitch deck</li>
                        <li>Finding and contacting other founders</li>
                        <li>Finding other ventures by name and industry</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <img src="/images/User%20testing%20screenshot.png"/>

                    <p>
                        After the interview, I asked each person to complete a
                        System Usability Questionnaire to give me an idea of
                        current user satisfaction.
                    </p>

                        After the interviews, I carried out affinity mapping to
                        help me identify users' key pain points.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I then created a list of "How Might We?" questions to
                        clarify what I needed to achieve. Before going ahead
                        with ideation, I consulted with the company founder to
                        identify any business matters which might affect my
                        ability to resolve these problems.

                        Based on the problems I identified, I mocked up some
                        basic wireframes to gather feedback from users and the
                        Tribe engineers. This involved rethinking information
                        heirarchies and layouts, designing a new filtering
                        system and providing more visual cues and information to
                        help users achieve their goals.

                        After creating my initial basic wireframes, I conducted
                        more user testing to gather feedback on the initial
                        design ideas. The feedback was overall more positive
                        than for the MVP, but I was able to identify some areas
                        where I could hone the design even further.
